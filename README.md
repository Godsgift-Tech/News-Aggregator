In this project, I created a simple web application using ASP.NET Core MVC and Web API.
The app is built to display the latest news headlines from different sources, allowing users to search for articles on specific topics and filter them by category.
You will integrate with an external news API (Use https://newsapi.org/) using HttpClient to fetch news data and display it on your platform.
I implemented an external APIs using HttpClient in ASP.NET Core.
Perform CRUD operations and display data in an organized manner using ASP.NET Core MVC.
Practice working with Entity Framework Core for managing search history.
Implement pagination and search functionality.
Develop a clean and responsive UI using Bootstrap.
I implemented a search bar where users can search for news articles by keyword.
Calling the API using the search query and display the results.
I added a dropdown to filter news articles by category (e.g., Technology, Sports, Health).
Clicking on a news headline should show more details about the article in a new view (including content, author, etc.).
I finally implemented pagination (using X.PagedList) to handle large lists of news articles.
